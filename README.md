# Node.js' Tooling Group

> Advancing Node.js as a framework for writing great tools

## What nodejs/tooling Is

- **nodejs/tooling** is a place to propose and discuss initiatives around improving the developer experience for those writing tools using Node.js.
- **nodejs/tooling** is a group of developers who want to help. The team can be mentioned using the username @nodejs/tooling.

## What nodejs/tooling Is Not

- **nodejs/tooling** has nothing to do with internal tools or automation for the Node.js project. Maybe you were looking for [nodejs/build](https://github.com/nodejs/build) or [nodejs/automation](https://github.com/nodejs/automation)?
- **nodejs/tooling** is not an official "working group"; it presently has no charter.
- There are *no actual tools* in **nodejs/tooling**.

## "Tools" Definition

It may be easiest to provide this *non-exhaustive* list of examples:

- Test runners & linters
- Build tools & bundlers
- Task runners
- Package managers
- System utilities
- Compilers, transpilers & language servers
- Modules, projects & libraries supporting these use cases

## How to Help

- Provide [user feedback](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback)--how do you use Node.js to write tools? What's good? What could be better?
- Create [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) and participate in discussions
- Attend online meetings
- Document initiatives and send them as PRs
- Help us formalize stuff if it's too loosey-goosey, b/c I'm just making this up as I go rn
